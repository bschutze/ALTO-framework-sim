ALTO-framework-sim
==================

Framework for creating ALTO networkmap and costmap used on my mater thesis to simulate an ALTO server. Framework reads in .DOT file graphs, parses them and creates network and cost map. This is developed to see how a deployed ALTO server can enhance common internet measuring techniques.
