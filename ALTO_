NETWORK MAP: (update cycle: slow)

The definition of Network Map is based on the observation that in reality, many endpoints are close by to one another in terms of
network connectivity. By treating a group of close-by endpoints together as a single entity, an ALTO Server indicates aggregation of
these endpoints due to their proximity. This aggregation can also lead to greater scalability without losing critical information when
conveying other network information (e.g., when defining Cost Map). 

A key use case of PIDs is to specify network preferences (costs) between PIDs instead of individual endpoints. This allows cost
information to be more compactly represented and updated at a faster time scale than the network aggregations themselves.


COST MAP: (update cyle: fast)

An ALTO Server indicates preferences amongst network locations in the form of Path Costs. Path Costs are generic costs and can be
internally computed by a network provider according to its own policy.(ex: throughput, latency, hopcount, etc...)

For a given Network Map, an ALTO Cost Map defines Path Costs pairwise amongst sets of source and destination Network Locations defined by
PIDs defined in the Network Map. Each Path Cost is the end-to-end cost when a unit of traffic goes from the source to the destination.
